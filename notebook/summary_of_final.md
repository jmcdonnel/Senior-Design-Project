## Summary of Final Implementation  
### Design  
The final design of the game is close to what we had envisioned from the start.  
The game has a dungeon-esque vibe to it, while still maintaining the sports themes we were gearing towards.  

### Limitations  
The most obvious limitation during our time in Senior Desing would be COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, we were unable to meet in person to discuss and work on the project. Doing everything remotely ultimately worked, but it was certainly not the easiest method of coordination.  
The initial learning curve to Unity slowed us down a bit, but once everyone got the hang of it things started to progress well.  
Finally, every single team member took on some aspect of the project that involved things they had never done before. While the learning curve was steep, the experience was worth it.  

### Future Direction  
From its current implementation we would simply add on more procedurally generated levels. Each would have its own particular theme revolving around different sports. Spit and polish would come along with this as well.  

### Statement of Work  
Asher: Procedurally generated levels, sprites and animations, general coding  
Jack: Sound design, lighting, minimap, general coding  
Kyler: UI design, enemy spawners, general coding  
Stephen: Enemy and boss navigation and AI
